# Sailboat - Voilier
INSA Toulouse 4th year - Informatique MatÃ©rielle

This project contains a program to control sailboat operations based on the model used in our lab at INSA de Toulouse using a STM32F103 along with different sensors on a model sailboat.
The sailboat was able to adjust course with a remote, adjust rigging according to perceived wind direction and release sails upon rolling of the sailboat at an angle > 45 degrees which was measured by an accelerometre.
The project was done using the Keil IDE.
